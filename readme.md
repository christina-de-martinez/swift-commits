## âœ¨ As easy as knowing all the words to your old favorite song

- Choose between [quill, fountain pen, or glitter gel pen](https://youtu.be/xMy8ZGlKf1U?si=kFeh3DoaALLQu3DN&t=276) commit types.
- Select which era your code belongs inâ€”that's your scope.
- Choose from pre-selected lyrics that match your type and scopeâ€”your new commit message.
- Get commit messages like these:

```
quill(midnights): It was all by design, cause I'm a mastermind.
fountain(midnights): Dear reader, burn all the files.
glitter-gel(fearless): It's flawless, really something.
```


## ðŸš€ Is it too soon to do this yet?

```sh
npm install -g swift-commits
```

When you're ready to commit. To run the CLI in your terminal:

```sh
swift-commits
# or
npx swift-commits
```

It will prompt a series of questions. These prompts will build a commit message, which you can preview, before confirming the commit.

## ðŸŒŒ Long live all the magic we made

## ðŸª¶ It was all by design

The two masterminds who correctly guessed the number of references in my video are <a href="https://github.com/craftycarmen" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">craftycarmen</a> and <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@sabz.i" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Shereen</a>.

Technically it was 14 references, but 13 lyrics:

* Treacherous
* All Too Well
* Long Story Short
* I can fix it (no really, I can)
* Style
* Era (reference, but not really a lyric)
* Midnights (I didn't originally count this one since I was just narrating what was on the screen)
* It was all by design because I'm a mastermind
* Hits different
* You are in love
* I wish you would
* I gave my blood, sweat, and tears for this
* You need to calm down
* Eyes open
